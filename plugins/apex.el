;;; apex.el --- A plugin to allow editing code with the apex framework

;; Author: Lukas Jenks <lukasjenks@gmail.com>
;; Version: 1.0
;; Package-Requires ((none))
;; Keywords: javascript, web
;; URL: https://github.com/lukasjenks/.emacs.d

;;; Commentary:

;; apex.el is a simple set of interactive functions which
;; enable the user to edit code in the apex web framework.

;;; Usage Guide:

;; First, place this file in your .emacs.d directory.  Then, in init.el
;; add the following Lisp form: (load "~/.emacs.d/apex.el")

;; Replace username and password value on line 58 with the administrator
;; username and password that you use to login normally.

;; First, you must login to the web service.  You can do that by executing:
;; M-x a-login
;; When you receive the message: "Authentication successful." in the minibuffer,
;; you are ready to start using this plugin.

;; How to access and edit code:
;; M-x a-get-list
;; Executing this and responding to its prompts will open a new buffer with
;; a list of the names of all  either [reducers/logic/rules] in the database.

;; M-x a-get-code
;; Executing this and responding to its prompts will open a new buffer with
;; the contents of a certain [reducer/logic/rule] given its name.  You can
;; then edit the code in this buffer.

;; M-x a-post-code
;; Once you are done editing the code using a-get-code, use this function
;; to post that code back in the database.

;;; Code:
(require 'json)
(require 'url)

;; The following line is necessary to prevent url.el from automatically
;; adding the header Accept-Encoding: gzip to every request (idk man)
